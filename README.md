## About

Transcending the mundane limitations of traditional dishwashing through quantum-enhanced hydrokinetic resonance, blockchain-verified sanitization protocols, and AI-powered plate alignment optimization - where forks achieve perfect angular momentum, knives slice through space-time, plates orbit in quantum harmony, and glasses resonate at exactly 420.69 Hz in a choreographed swirl of ultra-precise washing algorithms. Because even in 2025, someone still needs to load the dishwasher.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Bubble Harmonizationâ„¢**: Leverages quantum entanglement to synchronize water molecule vibrations
- **Neural-Network Enhanced Load Detection**: 99.9% accuracy in determining whether that spoon is actually facing the right way up
- **Blockchain-Verified Cleanliness**: Each cleaning cycle recorded on our decentralized DishChainâ„¢
- **Zero-Latency Hydro Matrix**: Ensures each droplet follows the most efficient route with minimal packet loss
- **Bio-Mimetic Steam Distribution**: 420% more efficient than traditional methods
- **Web4.0-Ready Interface**: Metaverse-compatible with AR-enhanced loading guidance

## Technical Specifications

```typescript
class DishwasherMetrics {
  readonly QUANTUM_EFFICIENCY = 69.420;
  readonly BUBBLE_RESONANCE = 420.69;
  readonly DIMENSIONS = 11;  // Because 10 wasn't enough
}
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Blockchain Status |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Quantum Swirl Efficiency | 420.69 megaSwirls/cycle | Verified |
| Bubble Harmony Rating | 69.420 gigaBubbles/second | Verified |
| Fork Confusion Rate | < 0.1% | In Superposition |
| Quantum Entanglement | Perfect | Maybe |

## Hackathon Status

```
Dear Dr. Professor McSplashy III,

We regret to inform you that your application to HackMcTech 2025 has been rejected for the following reasons:

- Your project seems to be "just a dishwasher" with unnecessary quantum computing
- Adding blockchain to kitchenware doesn't make it innovative
- The AI component appears to just be "if spoon then flip()"
- Water being "optional" raises concerns
- Your quantum bubble calculations exceeded our universe's computational limits

However, we are impressed by your creative use of buzzwords and have decided to award you:

- Most Unnecessarily Complex Solution to a Simple Problem
- Best Use of Quantum Physics Where None Was Required
- Most Innovative Way to Waste Water and Electricity

Best regards,
HackMcTech Committee
```

## Technology Stack

- Quantum Framework: DishJS 4.20
- Neural Networks: SpoonNet v69
- Blockchain: DishChainâ„¢
- Database: Quantum State Storage
- Frontend: React + Web4.0
- Reality Engine: Maybe

## Tokenomics

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $DISH69
- 60% Liquidity: For making sure our token is as wet as your dishes
- 38% Developer Wallet: Locked for 3 months because we pinky-promised
- 2% DISH69 SwirlWallet: For when stuff breaks and we need to pretend we have a backup plan

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the quantum repository
git clone https://github.com/Dishwasher69-6000/quantum-dish.git

# Install dependencies (and quantum dependencies)
npm install
quantum install
blockchain install

# Initialize quantum state
npm run quantum-init

# Start your dishwasher
npm run wash
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run quantum tests
npm test

# Check quantum entanglement
npm run test:entangle

# Verify blockchain state
npm run test:blockchain

# Make sure spoons are actually spoons
npm run test:spoon-validation
```
