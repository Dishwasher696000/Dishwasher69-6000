## About

Transcending the mundane limitations of traditional dishwashing through quantum-enhanced hydrokinetic resonance, blockchain-verified sanitization protocols, and AI-powered plate alignment optimization - where forks achieve perfect angular momentum, knives slice through space-time, plates orbit in quantum harmony, and glasses resonate at exactly 420.69 Hz in a choreographed swirl of ultra-precise washing algorithms. Because even in 2025, someone still needs to load the dishwasher.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Bubble Harmonizationâ„¢**: Leverages quantum entanglement to synchronize water molecule vibrations
- **Neural-Network Enhanced Load Detection**: 99.9% accuracy in determining whether that spoon is actually facing the right way up
- **Blockchain-Verified Cleanliness**: Each cleaning cycle recorded on our decentralized DishChainâ„¢
- **Zero-Latency Hydro Matrix**: Ensures each droplet follows the most efficient route with minimal packet loss
- **Bio-Mimetic Steam Distribution**: 420% more efficient than traditional methods
- **Web4.0-Ready Interface**: Metaverse-compatible with AR-enhanced loading guidance

## Technical Specifications

```typescript
class DishwasherMetrics {
  readonly QUANTUM_EFFICIENCY = 69.420;
  readonly BUBBLE_RESONANCE = 420.69;
  readonly DIMENSIONS = 11;  // Because 10 wasn't enough
}
```

## Hackathon Status

```
Dear Dr. Professor McSplashy III,

We regret to inform you that your submission to Hackathon 2025, "Dishwasher69 6000," has been disqualified due to multiple violations of our guidelines for theoretical innovation. After thorough review, our committee found the following issues with your application:

- Your project seems to function too effectively as an actual dishwasher rather than focusing on the purely theoretical realm.
- Quantum computing and blockchain integration in kitchen appliances were deemed "innovative but existentially unnecessary."
- The AI decision-making model appears to be glorified spoon-flipping (if spoon, then flip()).
- The inclusion of a "Water Optional" feature prompted concerns about user safety and realism.
- Your quantum bubble calculations exceeded the known computational limits of our universe, causing ripples in the space-time continuum.

Despite these setbacks, we are genuinely impressed by your imaginative approach and have decided to present you with the following accolades:
- "Most Unnecessarily Complex Solution to a Simple Problem"
- "Best Use of Quantum Physics Where None Was Required"
- "Most Innovative Way to Waste Water and Electricity"

We encourage you to continue pushing the boundaries of impractical yet fascinating innovation. The Hackathon Committee remains hopeful for your future endeavors, perhaps in developing a blockchain-based microwave for inter-dimensional cooking or AI-driven toaster orchestration.

Best regards,
Hackathon Committee
```

## Technology Stack

- Quantum Framework: DishJS 4.20
- Neural Networks: SpoonNet v69
- Blockchain: DishChainâ„¢
- Database: Quantum State Storage

## Tokenomics

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $DISH69
- 60% Liquidity: For making sure our token is as wet as your dishes
- 38% Developer Wallet: Locked for 3 months because we pinky-promised
- 2% DISH69 SwirlWallet: For when stuff breaks and we need to pretend we have a backup plan

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the quantum repository
git clone https://github.com/Dishwasher69-6000/quantum-dish.git

# Install dependencies (and quantum dependencies)
npm install
quantum install
blockchain install

# Initialize quantum state
npm run quantum-init

# Start your dishwasher
npm run wash
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run quantum tests
npm test

# Check quantum entanglement
npm run test:entangle

# Verify blockchain state
npm run test:blockchain

# Make sure spoons are actually spoons
npm run test:spoon-validation
```
